abstract: Tuning hyperparameters for unsupervised learning problems is difficult in
  general due to the lack of ground truth for validation. However, the success of
  most clustering methods depends heavily on the correct choice of the involved hyperparameters.
  Take for example the Lagrange multipliers of penalty terms in semidefinite programming
  (SDP) relaxations of community detection in networks, or the bandwidth parameter
  needed in the Gaussian kernel used to construct similarity matrices for spectral
  clustering. Despite the popularity of these clustering algorithms, there are not
  many provable methods for tuning these hyperparameters. In this paper, we provide
  an overarching framework with provable guarantees for tuning hyperparameters in
  the above class of problems under two different models. Our framework can be augmented
  with a cross validation procedure to do model selection as well. In a variety of
  simulation and real data experiments, we show that our framework outperforms other
  widely used tuning procedures in a broad range of parameter settings.
